# NYC_spatial_census

This repository contains the 2020 data published by New York City's Department of City Planning, merged with the geometries for each census tract. I also included the original data dictionary

Original dataset can be found here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/nyc-population/2020-census.page

And the census tracts can be found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2020-Census-Tracts-Mapped/weqx-t5xr
